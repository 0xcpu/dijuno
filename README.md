POC (in _C_) from [Exploiting (Almost) Every Antivirus Software](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-software/)

__Note:__
> Almost all of our antivirus exploits for Windows are similar in nature. In some cases, we had to implement timeout values to cause a delay between downloading the EICAR test-string and creating the directory junctions. As with most race conditions, timing is everything but itâ€™s easy to figure out the exact values with minimal effort.
